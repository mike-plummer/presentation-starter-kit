## What is a generator?

Think of it as a special kind of iterator object

- Generator function constructs an instance of the iterator
- Instances are independent
- Contains normal JS logic
- The `yield` keyword generates a value from the iterator
- `.next()` returns a value from the iterator, plus indicates whether more values exist

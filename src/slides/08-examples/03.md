## Building a Watcher

```javascript
// Build a handler that manages interaction with Action
const handler = takeEvery(mySaga, ...args);

// Kick off to run in the background
const backgroundFlow = fork(handler);

// yield to allow redux-saga to manage it
yield childFlow;
```

```javascript
// ...or more simply
yield fork(takeEvery(mySaga, ...args));
```

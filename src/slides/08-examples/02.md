## Watchers

A Watcher constantly runs in the background as a forked flow

redux-saga provides helpers to assist with common Redux Action stimuli

| Stimuli                                  | Helper                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Execute saga every time action occurs    | takeEvery(saga, ...args)  |
| takeEvery, cancel any previous instances | takeLatest(saga, ...args) |

```javascript
// Build a handler that manages interaction with Action
const handler = takeEvery(mySaga, ...args);
// Kick off to run in the background
const backgroundFlow = fork(handler);
// yield to allow redux-saga to manage it
yield childFlow;

// ...or more simply
yield fork(takeEvery(mySaga, ...args));
```

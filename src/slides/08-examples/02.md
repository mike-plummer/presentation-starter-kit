## Watchers

A Watcher constantly runs in the background

redux-saga has some helpers to build watchers

| Stimuli                                   | Helper                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Execute saga every time action occurs     | `takeEvery(action, saga, ...args)`  |
| takeEvery & cancel any previous instances | `takeLatest(action, saga, ...args)` |
